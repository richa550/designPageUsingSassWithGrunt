How to use Sass Files in project using Grunt Compiler

### Instructor:Richa

Today, we'll learn how to use Sass files with Grunt. Instead of Grunt, we could just as easily use another task runner like Gulp, webpack, or npm scripts. Here we are using Grunt.

#Make sure you've installed  Node.js and npm  in your machine. To test your machine versions, execute node -v and npm -v.

#Run npm install -g grunt-cli. This command will install the latest version of Grunt’s command line interface (CLI) globally. (if you face any issue pls refer  https://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli  )

#Navigate to the project’s root directory. open command window.

#Run npm install. This command will install all the project dependencies ( it will create the “node_modules” folder) 

#Run Grunt with grunt. Hopefully, this task will be executed correctly and you won’t encounter any errors. If errors do occur, make sure that steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully.

#Open your browser and type http://localhost:3000. You should see home page.
